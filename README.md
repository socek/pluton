# Pluton - Simple Monitoring System
## 1. Idea
We want to make simple monitoring system, which will just send event from endpoint to monitoring server via http.
## 2. Develop
After clonning the code, you should use:
```
$ make
```
This will create virtualenv envoritment. After that you can switch to it.
```
$ source ./venv_pluton/bin/activate
```
Now you should be able to run the server.
```
$ pcmd -s
```
